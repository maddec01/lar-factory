## 3. Brief

Write the brief to a file, then save it in the record with
`lar-work set-body <work ID> --revision N --body brief --file <file>`. The
user's original text stays in the record's initial context.

This private brief is the builder's handover. Editing it invalidates its prior
gate evidence. Run [Gate](gate.md) on the final text before marking it Ready.
This ordinary brief stays local. Structural sync shares only the shaping
results needed to explain a concept or multi-repository relationship. A provider
edit never rewrites this brief.

```markdown
## What
<the change, in the user's domain language>

## Done when
- <observable result a reviewer can check>

## Confirmed
- <each assumption the user confirmed, and each decision with its gist>

## Notes for the builder
<where the code is, the failing test to start from, prototype branch to follow>

## Domain docs
- Glossary: <each term to add or change, as a GLOSSARY-FORMAT.md entry>, or "none"
- ADRs: <each ADR to write, as an ADR-FORMAT.md draft>, or "none"

## Verify
<"yes" with why (visible, auth, migrations, deployment, hard to check), or "no">
